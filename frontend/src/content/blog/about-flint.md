Welcome to Flint! We’re on a mission to fuel smarter living with AI—starting with nutrition.

Flint is your personal AI nutritionist. Built with cutting-edge technology and grounded in real human behavior, Flint tracks what you eat, helps you build healthier habits, and adapts to your unique lifestyle. We created Flint because we believe nutrition should be simple, personalized, and empowering—not overwhelming.

## Why We Built Flint

Most nutrition apps focus on numbers. They make you count calories, weigh portions, and obsess over grams of protein or carbs. We think that’s outdated. People don’t live their lives in spreadsheets—and nutrition shouldn’t feel like one.

We built Flint because we wanted a better way. A system that understands you. One that doesn’t just track your meals but learns your preferences, moods, and patterns. Flint is designed to help you grow—not guilt you into perfection.

## How Flint Works

Flint uses state-of-the-art AI to turn complex nutrition science into simple guidance. Here’s what it can do:

- **Food Logging, Reinvented:** Log your meals by talking, typing, or snapping a photo—whatever’s easiest. Flint understands natural language and images.
- **Personalized Coaching:** Flint adapts its suggestions based on your habits and goals. It remembers what you like and gently nudges you toward healthier choices.
- **Smart Feedback:** No lectures. No red flags. Just intelligent, actionable advice in a tone that feels like a friend, not a drill sergeant.

## Who It’s For

Whether you're starting a health journey, training for performance, or just curious about what you eat—Flint is for you. You don’t have to be a fitness junkie or a nutrition nerd. You just have to be human.

## What’s Next

We’re just getting started. Flint will soon integrate more wellness tools, like habit tracking, smart goal setting, and syncing with wearables. We’re also focused on community features that let users learn from each other’s journeys.

This is the future of personalized health—and we’re excited to build it with you.
